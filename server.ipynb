    "OSCshell is an OSC-based service for unsecurely running shell commands via OSC using [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc) on your favorite [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (my favorite distro is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)) running a [Python3](https://www.python.org/) kernel.
